      <h2>Biography</h2>

      <p>
      Passionate about tech and fueled by a love for coding, I kicked off my journey as a self-taught web developer, diving deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That led me into the world of full-stack development. I've been lucky to work on all sorts of UI/UX projects, fine-tuning my skills for crafting smooth user experiences and eye-catching responsive designs. With experience in object-oriented languages like Python and C++, I'm comfortable on both the front-end and back-end of things. I'm also gaining familiarity with tools like MongoDB, React, Express, and Node.js., and built and ran CI/CD pipelines using DevOps tools, making sure software projects sail out smoothly. This hands-on experience has given me a full-circle view of the development journey, from the first spark of an idea to the final launch. I'm always interested in continuously learning, and enthusiastically grab onto any other languages, frameworks, or principles that I can integrate into my current stack of skills.
