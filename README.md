# Portfolio

## Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to develop a portfolio that not only showcases my work but also demonstrates my proficiency in React concepts and API fetching. By creating this portfolio, I aimed to enhance my skills in these areas and provide a visually appealing representation of my capabilities.

## Screenshots

- **Inspiration/Mood Board**: An initial collection of images, colors, and styles that served as the creative foundation for the project.
- **Wireframe**: A visual blueprint that outlines the structure and layout of the portfolio's user interface.
- **Current Product**: Screenshots or images showcasing the actual portfolio in its current state.
- **Example of Mapping Pulled from Data in Components**: Demonstration of utilizing data pulled from an API and mapping it to components within the portfolio.

## How to Use

To explore the portfolio, you can visit the [deployed website](https://sparkling-otter-654705.netlify.app/). The portfolio provides a comprehensive overview of my work, skills, and projects. Each section or page will guide you through different aspects of my journey and accomplishments.

## Technology Used

The portfolio was developed using the following technologies:

- **React**: The core framework used to build the interactive user interface.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language for adding interactivity and functionality.
- **CSS**: Styling language responsible for the visual presentation of the portfolio.
- **HTML**: Markup language used to structure and organize content.
- **Netlify**: Hosting platform utilized for deploying the portfolio and making it accessible online.

## Challenges

The project presented several challenges that allowed me to grow as a developer:

- **Routing Practice**: Implementing routing within the portfolio provided valuable experience in creating a multi-page application.
- **Pages vs. Components Organization**: Deciding how to structure the project into pages and reusable components required thoughtful organization.
- **Passing Data via Props**: Learning how to lift and pass data between components effectively was a significant learning point.

## Upcoming Features

I'm excited to introduce the following features in the near future:

- **Incorporation of CSS Framework**: I plan to integrate a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind to enhance the design and streamline the styling process.
- **Enhanced Responsiveness**: Making the portfolio more responsive across different devices will be a priority. This will ensure a seamless experience for users accessing the portfolio on various screen sizes.

## Features

One of the key features of the portfolio is the implementation of a `data.js` file that centralizes content. This approach enables easy content updates without redundant copying and pasting. By importing the content from this file, I can focus on refining styles and layouts. Additionally, I plan to incorporate my resume into the portfolio for future enhancements.
